// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
// The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// Example 1:
// Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']

// Example 2:
// Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. 
// This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']

// same as longest substring with k (K == 2 in this case)
